* Documentation

-SAEnimate.css is a free to use, ready to go plug and play library. Great for details, emphasis and attention grabbing objects. 
        
* How to work the library:

-Link saenimate.css to the desired .html file.
-Saenimate animations work only if .saenimate class is applied to an element before defining the animation.
-Animations classes do not work on their own, it is necesasry to add duration and repetition. More on this in following section.
        
* Files & Making an animation:

-The SAEnimate file comes with four files in it

    -Keyframes
    -Classes
    -Duration
    -Repetition
         
-Keyframes can be left alone, or edited to user own liking.
-To make an animation, it is necessary to add saenimate, a class, a duration and a repetition. Eg: 'saenimate beat repeat-1 duration-2'.

* Best way to work the library:

-Animations can be a powerful tool if used in a good and orderly manner.
-Avoid using animations just to use them, as that can and most likely will deteriorate your UX. No one likes bouncing annoying elements just beacuse.
-Careful when animating large objects, as they may not work the way it's expected. It also goes hand in hand with the UX, as it can be annoying to have a large element animated.
-Avoid infite animations. A class for infinte animations has been made, but use it sparingly, if ever, as it can be viewed as a bad UX practice.
-Inline elements CANNOT be animated. If you'd like an inline element to be animated, remember to change its display to inline-block, or don't do it at all.
-Remember, with great tools, comes great responsibility :)
